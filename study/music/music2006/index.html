  <h1>
Top Ten Albums of 2006
</h1>
  
<p>In this, what is probably my last post before I turn 24, I discuss my top ten albums released in 2006.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Decemberists, <em>The Crane Wife</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000HKDEEW.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V59841508_.jpg" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost hesitant to put this at the top of my list, since I got it less than a month ago and started really listening to it only recently, but I can&rsquo;t rank anything else above it. Several of the songs are stunning, and remarkably the Decemberists are at their best on this album when they&rsquo;re trying new things. For examples of this, see the three-part title track, the third part of which opens the album and is probably the most poignant song I&rsquo;ve heard all year based on the strength of its melody alone. The first and second parts then come as the second-to-last song on the album, enfolding it nicely and giving it a feeling of completeness. And what good stuff there is in between those two bookends. &ldquo;The Island&rdquo; sprawls elliptically, &ldquo;The Perfect Crime #2&rdquo; bumps and shakes like a literary &ldquo;Ocean&rsquo;s Twenty-five&rdquo; (though God help us if such a movie is ever actually made) and &ldquo;When the War Came,&rdquo; though it&rsquo;s probably longer than it needs to be, rocks harder than anything the Decemberists have done before.</p>

<p>Most of the rest of the tracks, especially &ldquo;Yankee Bayonet&rdquo; and the single &ldquo;O Valencia!&rdquo; are classic Decemberists, which is never a bad thing; the only one that&rsquo;s even slightly weak is &ldquo;Summersong,&rdquo; and even it isn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>. Overall <em>The Crane Wife</em> is such a natural extension of what made the Decemberists a remarkable band in the first place, and such a great album, that I had to give it #1 for the year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Destroyer, <em>Destroyer&rsquo;s Rubies</em>.</strong></p>

<p>This was my number 1 until just about ten minutes ago, actually, when I thought about it, realized that it kind of peters out at the end (for me, at least) and had to give <em>The Crane Wife</em> the edge. It&rsquo;s still an incredible album, though, a great introduction to Destroyer&rsquo;s &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know &ndash; mythos, and a good starting point from which to dive into (its? his?) back catalogue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write about Destroyer, because so many other reviewers like to write about it, so I&rsquo;ll just say that no one else writes lyrics like Dan Bejar: others might match his level of impenetrability, but no one can hold a candle to the sort of musical architecture he&rsquo;s built up, about which I&rsquo;m trying to dance right now, with its countless self-references and idiosyncrasies. By itself, this would be enough to make Destroyer fascinating; the fact that it&rsquo;s married to some fantastic tunes makes him thoroughly enjoyable, too. The nine-minute opening track &ldquo;Rubies&rdquo; is one of those long songs that seems, to me, very short, and by and large the rest of the album maintains that level of quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gnarls Barkley, <em>St. Elsewhere</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000F3AAUW.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V53951098_.jpg" /></p>

<p>Considerations of quality, for the moment, aside, I think one of the reasons this album is so high in my list is its potent combination of eccentricity and universal appeal. It&rsquo;s a really weird album, swinging from gospel to hip-hop to rock back to some kind of soul or something, but everyone I&rsquo;ve talked to about it has liked the majority of the songs on it, and I can&rsquo;t really imagine anyone disliking the whole thing. Sure, everyone&rsquo;s sick of &ldquo;Crazy&rdquo; by now, but try and think back on the first few times you heard it: didn&rsquo;t it <em>deserve</em> to be ubiquitous for a while? I can&rsquo;t think of any other &ldquo;played-to-death&rdquo; song quite like it, and for that matter I can&rsquo;t think of any other album like <em>St. Elsewhere.</em></p>

<p>Everyone has their opinions on the high and low points of this album, and I&rsquo;m no exception: I could take or leave &ldquo;The Last Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who Cares?&rdquo; but I love the hectic two minutes of &ldquo;Transformer,&rdquo; which some probably find annoying, and the dark groove of &ldquo;Necromancer,&rdquo; which probably turns some people off as well. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve met a person who dislikes &ldquo;Just a Thought.&rdquo; My point is, I guess, that this album is a uniter <em>and</em> a divider, like most great pieces of art are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Fiery Furnaces, <em>Bitter Tea</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000EQ5Q86.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V57015745_.jpg" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I love me some Fiery Furnaces, so this was bound to show up on here, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s the Furnaces that it&rsquo;s in my top 10.  In some ways it&rsquo;s like the other stuff they&rsquo;ve done, but in some ways it&rsquo;s not: &ldquo;Teach Me, Sweetheart&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black-Hearted Boy&rdquo; are dark and subdued (two words which could almost never have been applied to the Furnaces before this), &ldquo;The Vietnamese Telephone Ministry&rdquo; is genuinely frightening and totally unexpected, and &ldquo;Oh Sweet Woods&rdquo; is groovy and deliciously weird in a way that only the Fiery Furnaces can pull off.</p>

<p>Of course, the crazy synths that the Furnaces have employed gratuitously since <em>Blueberry Boat</em> are still around, and the backwards vocals are overbearing at times. But even Jess, who hates the Furnaces with a passion whose heat matches the band name&rsquo;s referent, can put up with &ldquo;Waiting to Know You,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Benton Harbor Blues&rdquo; is just sweet and sad and totally well-executed. In some ways <em>Bitter Tea</em> is more of the same, but it&rsquo;s also more delicate (though that&rsquo;s not saying much) and emotionally complex than anything I&rsquo;ve heard from the Furnaces before. In my weak moments I think I like it even more than <em>Blueberry Boat</em>, which totally rocked my world the first time I heard it. That&rsquo;s high praise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sunset Rubdown, <em>Shut Up I Am Dreaming</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000F8DB9E.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V54202328_.jpg" /></p>

<p>Along with <em>Destroyer&rsquo;s Rubies</em>, this album probably took me the longest to get into, but as with many slow-growing albums, it rewarded my patience with it richly. Sunset Rubdown has at its core Spencer Krug, who&rsquo;s probably most well known for being (the better) half of Wolf Parade, a band that got a lot of buzz a couple years ago. Here he doesn&rsquo;t share the lyric writing or the singing, and the result is that his weirdness is more focused, and eventually more effective.</p>

<p>Krug has a hell of a singing voice. It&rsquo;s the kind that makes you sit up and take notice, but not because it&rsquo;s grating or takes getting used to, like Destroyer&rsquo;s or Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s; if I had to describe it in one word, I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;strident.&rdquo; If that isn&rsquo;t enough, he writes a mean lyric as well: &ldquo;Us Ones In Between&rdquo; in particular is a song that I found sort of pedestrian until I read the lyrics, after which it was devastating. At first I thought this album was no fun, and I still maintain that it&rsquo;s kind of a downer. But it&rsquo;s also ridiculously brilliant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joanna Newsom, <em>Ys</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000I2K9M4.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V37460020_.jpg" /></p>

<p>This spot was a bit of a toss-up, but I had to put <em>Ys</em> here partly because it&rsquo;s (to use a tedious and overused adjective here) such an ambitious album and partly because it matches its ambition so well. And partly because it&rsquo;s the kind of album that confounds people when they hear it for the first time, because it&rsquo;s five songs totaling 55 minutes long and Joanna Newsom &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way to overstate this &ndash; basically sounds like an eight-year-old a lot of the time.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s great about <em>Ys</em> is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter that Newsom sounds like an eight-year-old, because she uses that voice to such great effect and her lyrics make it clear that she&rsquo;s no kid. Also her harp playing is so good and so appropriate that it makes the strings that flood this album seem kind of extraneous a lot of the time. I don&rsquo;t know. I have a hard time describing why this album is so good; I guess it&rsquo;s just that everything on it is so well done and fits together so perfectly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neko Case, <em>Fox Confessor Brings The Flood</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CS4L1E.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /></p>

<p>I had only heard the New Pornographers&#39; <em>Twin Cinema</em> before this, so it was really my introduction to Neko Case. And I&rsquo;m glad it was, because even after diving into both the Pornographers&#39; and Case&rsquo;s back catalogues, I still think <em>Fox Confessor</em> is her strongest work.</p>

<p>Basically what everyone talks about, when they&rsquo;re talking about Neko Case, is her voice; and while it is a hell of a voice, <em>Fox Confessor</em> wouldn&rsquo;t be so successful if it didn&rsquo;t put it to good use. The songs here are moody and powerful, and to my mind, the best are the shimmering sadness of &ldquo;Star Witness&rdquo; and the dark, relentless descent-into-madness tale &ldquo;Dirty Knife&rdquo;: two total opposites that encapsulate all the things that make Neko Case a musician, a complete package, rather than just a singer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Islands, <em>Return to the Sea</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000ELJAU6.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" /></p>

<p>The best pop album released in 2006 that I heard, by a long shot. But it&rsquo;s more than just a pop album, as the nine-and-a-half minute opener &ldquo;Swans (Life After Death)&rdquo; indicates and the hip-hop-infused &ldquo;Where There&rsquo;s a Will There&rsquo;s a Whalebone&rdquo; makes clear. Those are both strong tracks, to be sure, but where <em>Return to the Sea</em> really shines is in its pop: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Whitney, Bobby&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rough Gem&rdquo; are two outstanding tunes, sequenced right next to each other for a super duper power pop punch.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>Return to the Sea</em> loses its momentum in the last few tracks, which are passable but not up to the standard of what precedes them. This isn&rsquo;t enough, though, to keep the album from being a thoroughly enjoyable listen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thom Yorke, <em>The Eraser</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000FPYNR6.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V65902366_.jpg" /></p>

<p>Not as good as a Radiohead album, okay. But still pretty damn good, in my opinion: mostly what you&rsquo;d expect from Thom Yorke, in a way, due to the instrumentation being mostly electronic and the lyrics, well, typical Thom Yorke in mood. But it&rsquo;s also more straightforward, lyrically and musically: the songs have choruses and melodies and lines like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the future holds / Cause I&rsquo;m right here in your arms today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For me, the best stuff is near the end, which is unusual: there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Skip Divided,&rdquo; which is almost like a redux of &ldquo;A Wolf at the Door,&rdquo; the weird faux-rap that concluded Radiohear&rsquo;s last album; &ldquo;Atoms for Peace,&rdquo; probably the boldest song on here; &ldquo;And It Rained All Night,&rdquo; with its driving lyrical rhythm; and &ldquo;Harrowdown Hill,&rdquo; apparently the angriest song Yorke&rsquo;s ever written and maybe the strongest song on the album overall. <em>The Eraser</em> is a bagatelle when held up against Radiohead&rsquo;s recent albums, but taken on its own it&rsquo;s still a fine batch of songs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Danielson, <em>Ships</em>.</strong> <img class="albumcover" src="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000F2BXI6.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V55108315_.jpg" /></p>

<p>I need to spend some more quality time with this one, but even after not too many listens its strengths are already pretty obvious to me: it&rsquo;s fun, optimistic, and hectic, part typical indie rock and part weird spazzy art-twee. Also the lead singer sounds like the Modest Mouse guy, but without the half-baked philosophy and cynicism. Also, I can&rsquo;t listen to &ldquo;Did I Step On Your Trumpet&rdquo; or hear him say &ldquo;C&#39;mon&rdquo; at the beginning of &ldquo;Cast It At the Setting Sail&rdquo; without being totally sold.</p></li>
