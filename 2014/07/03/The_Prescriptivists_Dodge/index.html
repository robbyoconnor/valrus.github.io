The Prescriptivist's Dodge
</h1>
  
<p>A work friend and I were talking about this unfortunate piece of ad copy on Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/quicktype/">iOS 8 QuickType web site</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>iOS 8 predicts what you’ll likely say next.
No matter whom you’re saying it to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We work in the linguistics group at our company, and among most linguists, <em>prescriptivism</em> is considered kind of a shabby way to look at language. Prescriptivism is basically the stance that one particular way of speaking or writing should be favored over others, and while we can all enjoy a good-natured chortle at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uQ_extNBDA">Weird Al &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; a sign in a grocery store</a>, or the <a href="http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/">Unnecessary Quotes Blog</a>, it&rsquo;s both willfully blind to the mutability of language and sometimes very limiting to insist that everything needs to be grammatically &ldquo;correct&rdquo; all the time. &ldquo;Whom&rdquo; is technically correct here, but it sounds awkward and stilted for a company that likes to keep its products and advertisements approachable and down-to-earth. Using &ldquo;who&rdquo; instead might lose Apple points with prescriptivists, but I&rsquo;d argue that it accomplishes their other goals much more effectively.</p>

<p>But then take this other example, also from the Apple page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supported languages include English optimized for the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia; French; German; Italian; Portuguese optimized for Brazil; Spanish; and Thai. <strong>And,</strong> Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese Kanji input also continue to feature predictive input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite our best efforts not to wield prescriptivism against every text we see, my co-worker and I thought that &ldquo;And,&rdquo; at the beginning of a sentence was clunky. (Note that there is a prescriptivist injunction against starting a sentence with a conjunction like &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;although,&rdquo; but we actually only object to the comma.) Is there a rule against starting a sentence with &ldquo;and&rdquo; followed by a comma? I don&rsquo;t know, actually. But I still think it reads badly.</p>

<p>This leads me to the <em>prescriptivist&rsquo;s dodge</em>:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/posts/The_Prescriptivists_Dodge/prescriptivist-doge.jpeg" rel="bytebox"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/images/posts/The_Prescriptivists_Dodge/prescriptivist-doge.jpeg" /></a></p>

<p>Wait, no, I&rsquo;m sorry. That&rsquo;s the prescriptivist&rsquo;s <em>doge.</em> The prescriptivist&rsquo;s <em>dodge</em> is objecting to language that <em>happens</em> to be against some prescriptive norm, but not <em>because</em> it breaks that norm. No, the non-prescriptivist would never be so rigid and dogmatic! S/he objects only because this particular transgression—I&rsquo;m sorry, I mean &ldquo;choice&rdquo;&zwnj;—<em>sounds bad</em>. Just adhering to the admittedly arbitrary and archaic rules would, coincidentally, in this one particular case, result in something that sounds better.</p>

<p>Of course, &ldquo;better&rdquo; is subjective, and a lifetime of being taught that &ldquo;correct&rdquo; grammar is super important and seeing &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; grammar and minority dialects associated with ignorance and stupidity will tend to affect your opinion of what sounds &ldquo;better&rdquo; without your having much say in the matter. But the prescriptivist&rsquo;s dodge lets you continue to enforce fundamentally arbitrary norms without being one of <em>those assholes</em> who comments on Facebook posts being all &ldquo;I believe you meant &lsquo;its&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
