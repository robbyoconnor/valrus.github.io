2013 Music's Best Lines
</h1>
  
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Q: Do you fall so short of all that&rsquo;s in your heart / When your friends, who you should pull up, you instead pick apart? / Do you watch the world get cold and crushed and small / And when you could do so much, you do fuck all?&rdquo; –Okkervil River, &ldquo;All The Time Every Day&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>The &ldquo;Q&rdquo; is in the lyric, yes (though not sung): this song is a questionnaire; this verse a question and, though a painful one, not an accusation; the answer is the chorus is the song&rsquo;s title, repeated in various permutations in defiance, in the hope of exculpation, in anticipation of the final verse and its revelation that the singer/interrogator, too, has the same answer and that we should not be ashamed,  but neither absolved. All we can do, perhaps, is what the singer does: try, but try we must, all the time, and every day.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;Outside of the influential arms of your idolatries / The object will be turning goodbyes into good biology&rdquo; –The Uncluded, &ldquo;Organs&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>In a song which flips between tender emotion and ruthless pragmatism, between borderline PSA and animal mysticism, with as much charming awkwardness as it does Kimya Dawson&rsquo;s childish verses and Aesop Rock&rsquo;s gravelly verbosity, Aes delivers a couplet that concisely demonstrates the appeal of the whole Uncluded project. The strangely touching but still goofy play on words &ldquo;goodbyes/good biology&rdquo; is the icing on the cake.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;This is born alone, die alone / So my dialog&rsquo;s dastardly / Life&rsquo;s a tragedy generator operating at max capacity&rdquo; (El-P); &ldquo;My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pit bull in my pedigree / And dogs fight to the death. You say you better? You better be!&rdquo; (Killer Mike), –Run the Jewels, &ldquo;Twin Hype Back&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>It didn&rsquo;t seem right to have a line from just one of these two here, so I picked a couple that illustrate the dichotomy making Run the Jewels so compelling. The main mode in which both of these two operate at pretty much all times is aggression, of course: most any thirty second slice of this album or either of their recent solo albums is sufficient to demonstrate that. El-P&rsquo;s is born out of nihilism; Killer Mike&rsquo;s out of arrogance or, sometimes, righteousness. El-P &ldquo;never met a word [he] wouldn&rsquo;t, like a weapon, just brandish&rdquo;, and here they unroll out of him like a lash of barbed wire. Killer Mike, meanwhile, wields his like blunt instruments; I don&rsquo;t even generally like alliteration but here he makes it work for me.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tired arachnid spinning loose in my threads, building lifetimes of gossamer beds / And the filigree water drops around my head, they absorb every word that I said / There are no wings hitched to my spine, just an undying urge to climb / And I&rsquo;ll wait for my mother, supposing she&rsquo;d bother to hold me and keep me awhile&rdquo; –Laura Stevenson, &ldquo;L-DOPA&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>L-DOPA, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA">according to Wikipedia</a>, is a chemical used to increase dopamine concentrations in the brain. The song seems to focus on Laura Stevenson&rsquo;s somewhat fraught and distant relationship with her mother, but it also contains some of the most poignant and beautiful metaphors in any song I heard this year. This is the third of three of those metaphors and my favorite by a very thin margin. I have nothing to say by way of unpacking its meaning. I just think it is some of the most beautiful lyricism of 2013.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;They be shooting whether it&rsquo;s dark or not / I mean the days is pretty dark a lot / Round here it&rsquo;s easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot&rdquo; –Chance the Rapper, &ldquo;Paranoia&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>In an extremely obvious &ldquo;secret&rdquo; track after the freewheeling &ldquo;Pusha Man&rdquo; (who puts a secret song after the second track on an album?), Chance the Rapper brings some old-school Kanye-style frustration with the violence in his home city of Chicago. He&rsquo;s practically gritting his teeth in this line, conflating his fear of that violence with a frustration that even bougeois-ass white people like myself can relate to, in a way that&rsquo;s both funny and not.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;The paramedic thinks I&rsquo;m clever &lsquo;cause I play guitar / I think she&rsquo;s clever 'cause she stops people dying&rdquo; –Courtney Barnett, &ldquo;Avant Gardener&rdquo;</dt>
<dd> This line is the best from among several good ones on Barnett&rsquo;s pre-debut <em>Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas.</em> I don&rsquo;t think it needs a lot of explication. It&rsquo;s just a great line.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;Pockets stay on swole, peep the motherfucking cash flow / Niggas pay my loans just to finger fuck my asshole&rdquo; –Cakes Da Killa, &ldquo;Get Right (Get Wet)&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>Cakes Da Killa&rsquo;s <em>The Eulogy</em> starts with a minute or so of pitched up <em>MacArthur Park</em> and then this line, and it sets the tone for the whole album in terms of campy audacity and graphic sexual forthrightness. It&rsquo;s almost sure to induce a double take on your first listen and serves as a sort of &ldquo;Abandon all homophobia, ye who enter here&rdquo; warning.</dd>

<dt>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in your gun holster? / Oh, this? It&rsquo;s the de-negritizer / I shoot myself with it until I&rsquo;m whiter than Peter Piper / Now I&rsquo;ll be able to bow before a world leader&rsquo;s miter / And tell them the shackles on my Adidas sneakers need to be tighter&rdquo; –Busdriver, feature on Milo&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Gus Haynes Cribbage League&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>This is the line that made me sit up straight and pay attention to Busdriver. As with most rap lines, a significant portion of its appeal is in the delivery, and Driver&rsquo;s captures the exact blend of insouciance, cynicism and sarcasm that I feel this one demands. Plus the internal rhymes and callback to the hook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/18/us/adidas-shackle-shoes/">Adidas shackle sneaker reference</a> are sick. Sick enough that I don&rsquo;t care that I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what the man&rsquo;s getting at; do white people have to kowtow to world leaders more than black people do? Really? That seems pretty equal-opportunity to me. Anyway, these two bars rule and Busdriver is my favorite rapper of 2013.</dd>
