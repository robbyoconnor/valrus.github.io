Mapping Grief By Reflections
</h1>
  
<p>I mostly grieve second-hand.</p>

<p>Some combination of societal pressure and natural personal inclination
seems to have inoculated me against the first-hand variety,
so that I can, for example, look at the following facts
directly in their loathsome faces
and be relatively unscathed by them:
My cat Einstein, the first cat who was really <em>mine</em>,
rather than my family&rsquo;s,
is sick and going to die.
The vet gave us a prognosis and at no point
was there a mention of any time span greater than six months.
We&rsquo;re going to do what we can to spoil him and make him comfortable
in this twilight of his life,
and at some point —
perhaps when he is no longer happy enough to grace us with his legendary, bone-shaking purr —
we&rsquo;ll have him put to sleep,
and then all we&rsquo;ll have of him will be memories.</p>

<p>Abstractly, it seems like those facts should be enough
to make me a quivering mass.
I mean, Einstein is like 18 now
and I&rsquo;ve been dreading the inevitability of having his health take a turn
for probably a few years now.
But now I&rsquo;m in the midst of it,
and how do I feel?
Well, pretty fucking bad, actually,
but mostly not in a sad way.
Instead I&rsquo;m anxious and fretful and distractable
and I feel somehow <em>fragile</em>.</p>

<p>The weird physical manifestation of this fragility
is sort of like a low-grade fever:
a feeling that my skin is tender,
like I have a mild sunburn on my chest and back.
(I assume the slight edge of nausea is from anxiety.)
But the real sense of fragility comes from the feeling that second-order grief
could hit me even harder than it usually does.
Second-order grief is listening to a sad song,
or seeing someone else grieve openly.
Maybe it&rsquo;s that society trained me to respond to other people displaying grief
even as it trained me out of doing so myself,
or maybe it&rsquo;s just that other people being unguarded with their emotions
can get through my defenses in a way that I can&rsquo;t do myself.
The master&rsquo;s tools can&rsquo;t dismantle the master&rsquo;s wall.</p>

<p>When my father died suddenly, the first time I cried was over a week later,
when I saw my brother —
the one reknowned for his ability to hold an absolutely straight face
through any attempts to faze him —
break down.
On the other hand,
the song &ldquo;Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure,&rdquo;
by the Weakerthans,
is one of the few things in this world that can <a href="http://thevalrus.tumblr.com/post/17079159785/virtute-the-cat">reliably bring me to tears</a>.
I love it, and hate it, precisely because of its ability to make me let down my guard
in a way that it seems most other things can&rsquo;t,
and despite my girlfriend&rsquo;s asking me &ldquo;Why do you do that to yourself?&rdquo;
sometimes it just feels <em>right</em> to cry,
the same way sometimes we intentionally do things that scare or hurt us in other ways.
But now, in my current state of fragility,
I&rsquo;m afraid to listen to that song.
Maybe I don&rsquo;t want to cry when there&rsquo;s a chance that some part of it might be real,
that Einstein is sad and afraid and in pain and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.
Usually I can resist anthropomorphizing him this way.
But that song shatters my resistance in too many ways for me to risk it.</p>

<p>Someday soon I will wake up and,
for the first time in nine years,
there will no longer be an Einstein.
I know this,
and I can face it and be mostly unmoved.
But if I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSdRizGYb0">Woke Up New</a>,
even though it is about a person and not a cat,
that &ldquo;what do I do without you&rdquo; will somehow make it real.
And I&rsquo;ll have to really confront how maybe,
some cold winter morning after Einstein leaves,
it will be cold, so I&rsquo;ll put on a sweater and turn up the heat,
and then, suddenly and without warning,
the walls will begin to close in,
and there will be absolutely nothing I can do about it.</p>
