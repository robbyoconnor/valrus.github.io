<p>Inevitability didn’t make it any easier;<br>
I couldn’t prepare myself at all.<br>
There was a hundred meter tidal wave headed for me,<br>
and I was building a brick wall.  </p>

<p>Who was I kidding<br>
to think that time could heal a wound I hadn’t even been given?<br>
Now I’m tying on a bandage that was torn into ribbons.<br>
It doesn’t work and it hurts like the dickens.  </p>

<p>You only wanted three things in life.<br>
It was a kind of joke but I’ve been really dreading the punchline.<br>
The food and affection I could provide you with daily,<br>
but the sleeping is up to you, except for this one time.  </p>

<p>You used to seem to vibrate in sixteen different dimensions so how come all of my memories are quiet and empty?<br>
I can’t think back to all the good times without hacking through the bad ones so my only salvation is random acts of distraction.<br>
And every piece of fur I find in my clothing might be the last one.  </p>
