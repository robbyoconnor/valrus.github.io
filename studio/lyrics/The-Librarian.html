The Librarian
</h1>
    
    

<p>I got a lot of books on my shelf, but I don’t know what to do with myself.<br />
I’m flipping pages, looking for an answer that never comes.</p>
<p>I cross-referenced all the prime numbered pages!<br />
I tried reading every third word!<br />
I threw a paperback at the window, heard the crack and watched it crumple to the ground like a bird!</p>
<p>I sat by myself within the ever-present gloom,<br />
and the pages became wings and then they flew about the room,<br />
and as the fluttering of leaves reached a crescendo I could see<br />
all the truth that lay within those books laid bare before me!<br />
But before I could absorb it I was swallowed by the sound<br />
as it ended my ascension and it slammed me to the ground.<br />
And as I felt my knowledge swirl away like water down a drain I knew:<br />
the next day I would rise to start my fruitless search again.</p>
<p>I cannot synthesize these plotlines and trivia.<br />
I don’t know what’s real anymore.<br />
I need more information.<br />
I’m gonna make the journey way across the city to the bookstore.</p>
<p>I need to feed my library.</p>
