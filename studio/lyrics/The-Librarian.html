<div class="lyric">

<p>I got a lot of books on my shelf, but I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself.<br>
I&rsquo;m flipping pages, looking for an answer that never comes.  </p>

<p>I cross-referenced all the prime numbered pages!<br>
I tried reading every third word!<br>
I threw a paperback at the window, heard the crack and watched it crumple to the ground like a bird!  </p>

<p>I sat by myself within the ever-present gloom,<br>
and the pages became wings and then they flew about the room,<br>
and as the fluttering of leaves reached a crescendo I could see<br>
all the truth that lay within those books laid bare before me!<br>
But before I could absorb it I was swallowed by the sound<br>
as it ended my ascension and it slammed me to the ground.<br>
And as I felt my knowledge swirl away like water down a drain I knew:<br>
the next day I would rise to start my fruitless search again.  </p>

<p>I cannot synthesize these plotlines and trivia.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s real anymore.<br>
I need more information.<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna make the journey way across the city to the bookstore.  </p>

<p>I need to feed my library.  </p>
