A Dead Man

<div class="lyric">

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make a promise to a dead man.<br>
I don&rsquo;t have to make a promise to a dead man.<br>
You can&rsquo;t make me keep a promise to a dead man.<br>
There&rsquo;s no harm to break a promise to a dead man.  </p>

<p>Man, I can&rsquo;t imagine this actually fucking mattered to you.<br>
I know your heart was shattered so I grant you some latitude.<br>
But how you gonna saddle me with slapstick and platitudes,<br>
evacuate the map and make me maximally mad at you?<br>
I&rsquo;m not obliging in the best of conditions,<br>
so spare your moralizing if you don&rsquo;t respect my decisions.<br>
I restore a kind of normalcy in light of attrition<br>
If I ignore the way it tortures me to grapple an apparition.<br>
I’m haunted.<br>
I know we’re all kinda haunted,<br>
but some may be more than others.<br>
Example: me and my brothers.<br>
I’m never free of this vehemence; I don’t hear your rebuttals.<br>
But I see reprieve between my fear and subtle defiance.<br>
I recognize relying on trying to flee is timeless;<br>
if it means that I’m spineless that’s fine<br>
I’ll find a psychiatrist if I need to have time with it.<br>
Until then I consign it to the back of my mind.  </p>

<p>That’s why I&rsquo;ll never make a promise to a dead man.<br>
Don’t want to think about a promise with a dead man.<br>
I’ll never have to keep a promise to a dead man.<br>
Won&rsquo;t have my peace of mind disrupted by a dead man.  </p>

<p>Man, I frickin wish I could forget your little pitiful writ,<br>
in which you tried to stick me with some insignificant shit.<br>
If you could get your mind off yourself for a minute, you could have figured it was imminent that I was considered a grown man,<br>
picking plane tickets and phone plans.<br>
You could have witnessed it instead of bridging the River Styx,<br>
but couldn’t stick it out enough to listen to Foam Hands.<br>
(I think you might have liked it, oh man.)<br>
But since you been gone I got a cold stone heart:<br>
me and you or your memory steadily grown apart.<br>
So you won’t catch me regretfully moaning.<br>
That’s correct: effective starting now I’m rejecting extra emotion.<br>
Truthfully, what the hell did it ever do for me?<br>
Mentally uprooted, induced me to act stupidly?<br>
And it’s tomfoolery how you want me to mourn you.<br>
Well true love regrets to inform you that&hellip;  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to make a promise to a dead man.<br>
You can&rsquo;t make me make a promise to a dead man.<br>
I think I’ll never make a promise to a dead man.<br>
And I guess I&rsquo;ll never understand what made a dead man<br>
a dead man.  </p>

<p>Man, I guess that your perspective was compressed to &lsquo;bout the size of a molecule.<br>
Depression is oppressive when it festers in solitude.<br>
And I was never best at impressions of solidarity.<br>
The mess in my chest, yeah: I see it with total clarity.<br>
I don&rsquo;t need to be told that I did nothing to help you:<br>
every time you tried to put a feeler out I repelled you,<br>
every deal I made myself to be a healer had fell through,<br>
and now I’m gonna seal away the feelings expelled too.<br>
But it was never my job to be my father’s keeper.<br>
Yeah, I could say you’re with God, but I’m a nonbeliever.<br>
And you were too, so let’s dispense with the fantasies<br>
of gentle zephyr breezes and canopies or whatever.<br>
‘Cause what’s the fucking point of living in Xanadu<br>
when living with yourself is the last thing that you plan to do?<br>
I guess that feeling nothing is all that you really wanted.<br>
(I told you, I know I’m not the only one that’s haunted.)<br>
I guess we’re not so different, you and I:<br>
compounding our emotional interest until it’s do or die.<br>
But whereas you decided on taking the latter,<br>
I’m’a fake it for a decade then I’m breaking the pattern.  </p>

<p>And that’s the only promise that I’m making to you, dead man.  </p>
