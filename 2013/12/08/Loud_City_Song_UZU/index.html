Julia Holter, <em>Loud City Song;</em> Yamantaka // Sonic Titan, <em>UZU</em>
</h1>

<p>Sonically, these two albums couldn&rsquo;t be much more different. <em>Loud City Song</em> is a mellow, generally very quiet and unassuming <a href="http://juliashammasholter.com/">Julia Holter</a> joint, ecstatically praised by music critics as was its predecessor, last year&rsquo;s <em>Ekstasis</em>. <em>UZU</em>, on the other hand, is the long-awaited bombastic, diverse debut full-length from the Canadian visual art/music collective Yamantaka // Sonic Titan.</p>

<p>My expectations of how much I&rsquo;d enjoy them also differed hugely. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with <em>Ekstasis</em> and while it was interesting and novel, it never clicked with me at all. (This started to feel like a personal failing on my part when I saw someone compare it to Owen Pallett&rsquo;s <em>Heartland</em>, my second favorite album of 2010 and probably the one from that year with the most staying power.) But Yamantaka // Sonic Titan&rsquo;s mini-album <em>YT // ST</em> intrigued me by mixing charming, percussive pop (&ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k472YAVzoGU">Hoshi Neko</a>&rdquo;) and punishing, endurance-testing hard rock (&ldquo;A Star Over Pureland&rdquo;) and managing to stay cohesive, a bit like a more serious, more proggy Deerhoof. I wasn&rsquo;t always in the mood for <em>YT // ST</em>, but every time I listened to it I liked it more. So I was really looking forward to <em>UZU</em>, whereas <em>Loud City Song</em> I picked up mostly out of curiosity and the hope of redeeming myself for my inability to appreciate <em>Ekstasis</em>.</p>

<p>Well, neither made it into my top 10, but <em>Loud City Song</em> I liked considerably more than its predecessor, and <em>UZU</em> a great deal less, and I&rsquo;m lumping them together because of one characteristic that they, somewhat amazingly, share: rapping!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the loose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping">Wikipedia definition</a> of rapping, here—&quot;spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics&quot;—but both albums feature parts that fall in that category quite neatly. The difference goes a surprisingly long way toward explaining my reaction to each album. The rapping on <em>Loud City Song</em> is curious, but of a piece with the rest of the album: still quiet and contemplative, concerned with cocktail parties in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7paoM2cghjI">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwu6bZDRWOM">iterations</a> of &ldquo;Maxim&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the &ldquo;flavor to the sound of walking&rdquo; in &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5M8qRN_Rl0">In the Green Wild</a>&rdquo;. It lends the songs in which it appears a focus on rhythm whose lack was, I think, part of what kept me from getting into <em>Ekstasis</em>. I like it. Listen to <em>Ekstasis</em> and the prospect of Julia Holter rapping will seem absurd, but here it feels like a natural extension of <em>Loud City Song</em>&rsquo;s sound. I still can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of most of the lyrics, and most of the melodies aren&rsquo;t strong enough to keep me trying. But the instrumentation is more diverse than on <em>Ekstasis</em> and used well to create atmosphere. Atmospheric music is just not really my thing, I think.</p>

<p>The rapping on <em>UZU</em> is also a fairly natural extension of what&rsquo;s elsewhere on the album, but unfortunately I find it dreadful. It ruins <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=89iO84vztyM">the track on which it appears</a> for me and causes me to be preoccupied with its dreadfulness every time I think about listening to <em>UZU</em>. I can&rsquo;t find other reviews complaining about the utter dreadfulness of this rapping, so maybe this is all just my own biases, but I say if you sound like what I imagine <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12262006">Mister Band</a> sounds like, it&rsquo;s game over.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a shame, because there&rsquo;s plenty of other enjoyable stuff on <em>UZU</em> that shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked: more slow, quiet songs than on <em>YT // ST</em>, for example, some of them quite affecting. The opening couplet of the last track, &ldquo;Saturn&rsquo;s Return&rdquo;, is sung tenderly despite its ominous content: &ldquo;Promises made long ago / set fire to the earth below.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an intriguing enough piece of a story that it makes me want to listen to the rest of the album to see if I can find out what those promises were, and the ponderous piano in the backing track is a nice counterweight to the rollicking drums of &ldquo;Bring Me the Hand of Bloody Benzaiten&rdquo; and the thick, heavy guitars of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH3X4D0NyS8">One</a>.&rdquo; This album&rsquo;s pretty heavily backloaded, I think, and I like that.</p>

<p>But please save me from that dreadful rapping. I think it is symptomatic of one of the main reasons I don&rsquo;t like <em>UZU</em> as much as <em>YT // ST</em>: it seems to take itself far more seriously. Too seriously, I feel, for a band that previously recorded &ldquo;Hoshi Neko&rdquo; and claims on their <a href="http://paperbagrecords.com/artists/yamantaka-sonic-titan">label&rsquo;s page</a> to merge &ldquo;heavy metal’s brutish assault with Japanese manga’s cartoonish appeal&rdquo;. <em>UZU</em> has the brutish assault, but none of the cartoonish appeal. It&rsquo;s not as <em>fun</em> as its predecessor. So it&rsquo;s not a bad album (aside from that rapping, I cannot emphasize that enough), but it won&rsquo;t end up on my top 10 list.</p>
